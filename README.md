# CS193P-2015-Assignment-4

This Xcode project implements Assignment 4 in the iTunesU Stanford computer science
course named "Developing iOS 8 Apps with Swift", taught by Paul Hegarty. It runs in
the simulator in Xcode 6.3.2 on several different iPhones. It also runs fine on a
real iPhone 5S. This version does all the required tasks and none of the Extra Credit 
tasks. 

From the user's standpoint the design of the app needs improvement but this is the 
design specified in the assignment. I guess it's designed this way so a number of 
different development tasks can be included in one project, with usefullness not 
a primary goal.

I want to acknowledge help that I got from m2m's solution on github. For a while I was 
totally stuck and didn't see how to implement the Mentions tableView because I didn't 
realize how to put two different cell types into a tableView (one with text and another
with an image). What helped a lot was looking at M2M's solution on github. Many thanks 
for that. I ended up not doing it exactly the way he does but without seeing his example 
I probably would have given up. (see http://cs193p.m2m.at/tag/cs193p+assignment-4+2015/)

I'm a total novice with github. I hope I got this repository right. Any helpful
comments on either Assignment 4 or this github setup will be appreciated.
